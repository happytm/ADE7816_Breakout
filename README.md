# Breakout Board for ADE7816 6-Channel Energy Monitor ASIC

For those wanting to monitor lots of individual channels in a single-phase household the
[ADE7816](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ade7816.html)
is an ideal solution. It allows differential current sensors for 3 channels and single ended current
sensors for 3 more channels. The MCU interface is over the classic SPI bus, and Arduino driver will
