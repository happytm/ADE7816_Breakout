# Breakout Board for ADE7816 6-Channel Energy Monitor ASIC

For those wanting to monitor lots of individual channels in a single-phase household the
[ADE7816](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ade7816.html)
is an ideal solution. It allows differential current sensors for 3 channels and single ended current
sensors for 3 more channels. The MCU interface is over SPI or I2C bus, and Arduino driver will
be developed along with this breakout board.

## Supporting Software

There is work in progress on supporting this board in [Arduino](https://github.com/whatnick/ADE7816_Arduino) and [Micropython](https://github.com/whatnick/ade7816_micropython).

## Getting the hardware

The hardware can be obtained as PCB, PCB + Parts Kit or Fully assembled.
